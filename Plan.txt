Main Project Goal:
Create a calendar that is accessible from anywhere and to creat multiple control
devices to creat the events for the calendar.

Ideas:
	1. Creat a webpage to store the calendar and have the control devices send
  the event data to the website.
		a. In the testing part I will creat a local host and port forwarding but
      when it is ready to launch I will creat an actual website.
		b. The creat the events I want to creat a portable display box made from
      an Arduino, LCD display and a control dial to select and change the event
      details.
		c. The user will input the event and then it will be saved on an SD card
      so if the Arduino is turned off it will still be there. Once the control
      box is online (connects to WIFI) it will upload the event to the website.
		d. The website will then get the information and add the event to the
      calendar.

	2. Creat a java program with a full calendar

In-depth plan:
  website:
    Creat a website that will combine all of the great things from other
    calendars like google and outlook. As well to creat a back end to resive
    data from the controllers.

    Sidebar:
      The sidebar will be the main control center for the website.
      The main features on the sidebar:
        1. able to change from month, week and day view.
        2.
